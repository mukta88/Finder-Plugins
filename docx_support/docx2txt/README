docx2txt (http://docx2txt.sourceforge.net/) is a simple tool to generate
equivalent text files from Microsoft .docx documents, with an attempt towards
preserving sufficient formatting and document information, and appropriate
character conversions for a good text experience.

In case you come across some issue with it, or need a feature that can be
handled in docx to text conversion, please feel free to communicate. An
accompanying test .docx document depicting the issue/need and the corresponding
text file generated by MSOffice with character substitution enabled (or as you
would like the text file to be) will be helpful.

You can also track the project via http://sourceforge.net/projects/docx2txt .


How to Use
----------

You can do the text conversion in two ways.

1. Using docx2txt.sh :

   docx2txt.sh file.docx
          OR
   docx2txt.sh file

   In both these cases output text will be saved in file.txt .

2. Using docx2txt.pl :

   a. docx2txt.pl infile.docx outfile.txt

      Use - as the name of output text file, to send extracted text to the
      stdout/terminal.

   b. docx2txt.pl file.docx
             OR
      docx2txt.sh file

      In both these cases output text will be saved in file.txt .


Tune your Experience
--------------------

You can configure
- newline (Unix/Dos way),
- line width (used for short line justification)
- list level indentation amount
- list element indicator characters for different levels, and
- showing of hyperlink along with linked text
in docx2txt.pl to suit your formatting taste.

Currently 8 level list nesting is assumed, however if you want to deal with
deeper nesting, you can adjust that as well in the perl script, by following
the comments in the perl script.

Currently, hyperlinked text along with the corresponding URL, is presented as

hyperlinked text [HYPERLINK: hyperlink url]

Your feedback is awaited on this.


Note for MC (Midnight Commander) fans
-------------------------------------

You can add following binding in ~/.mc/bindings and view the text content of
.docx file by hitting F3 key (assuming default key mappings) after moving the
cursor over concerned filename in mc pannel.

# Microsoft .docx Document
regex/\.(docx|DOCX|Docx)$
	View=%view{ascii} docx2txt.pl %f -
